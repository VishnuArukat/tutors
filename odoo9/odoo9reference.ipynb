    "2. many2many\n",
    "    this for adding multiple records of another model to the current model. This one has additional option which can be added using the widget tag.Please refer this link https://goo.gl/fgyzLC\n",
    "        this will not add any new coloumns to the db instead of that it will create a new table with the ids of the two table like they are linked to each other.The table name is created by odoo automatically by combining the two table name and adding the suffix _rel this can be overwrite by the <i>relation</i> parameter as it is more secure, if the corresponding table names are large then the resulting table name will exede the psql limit of 63 character.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. many2one - this represents a many to one relation to a model which is same as dropown in html and which can have optional parameters such as ondelete,context,domain etc.\n",
    "    in the db level it will store the id of the referencing model and also this will create a db constraint as we mentioned below.By default no db index is created but this can be done using the index =True.\n",
    "    this type of fields have an additional parameter ,<i>auto_join</i> which can be used for one2many and many2one fields for fastening the search query on the db.For example if we have a many2one field on res.partner with domain like <br />\n",
    "    <code>[('bank_ids.name', 'like', 'foo')]  </code><br/>\n",
    "    this will perform 3 querys on the db as follows\n",

    "  <code>restrict - this will prevent any deletion of the related records</code><br/>\n",
    "  <code>no action - this will raise an warning when a related record is deleted this is the default behaviour of the ondelete</code><br/>\n",
    "  so both the no action and restrict are same in one sense, but in no action the constraint is postponded to last of transaction and in restrict it is triggered on the same moment.\n",
    "  <code>cascade - Means when a row is deleted the referencing row's also deleted</code><br/>\n",
    "  <code>set null - Means when a referenced value is deleted the referencing row's also set to null</code><br/>\n",
    "  <code>set default - Means when a referenced value is deleted the referencing row's also set to default value,the catch is that if the default value do not satisfy the foreign key constraint,then the operation fails.</code><br/>\n",
    "  <strong>Basically this are operation on psql level,like when the default is called the psql alter command is called.</strong>\n",
    "  <br/>\n",
    "  <strong>For an example if one record has a many2one to a res.partner and whihc is referencing to a partner in partner table then if we delete the partner from the res.partner then the field is referencing to a partner which does not exist which will lead to an error.To remove that error we can use the ondelete functionality of the psql for what to do when the parent is deleted.So basically the field is the foriegn key which is equal to the primary key of the res.partner which is the id of the res.partner refer stackoverflow https://goo.gl/NYWwYq </strong>\n",
